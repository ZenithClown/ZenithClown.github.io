<h1 align = "center">Codes Showcase Directory</h1>

<div align = "justify">

The objective of this directory is to showcase the code developed throughout my professional career, highlighting my
expertise and experience in various domains and technologies. Additionally, it serves as a repository for code documents,
providing comprehensive insights into the implementation details and functionalities of the developed solutions.

The `python` code documentation is generated using [**`sphinx`**](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and I generally
follow the ["PEP 287 â€“ reStructuredText Docstring Format"](https://peps.python.org/pep-0287/) for code documentation. The
[modules](./modules/) directory contains all my showcased codes added as
[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for faster access.

## Getting Started

The code is publicly available at [**gists/ZenithClown**](https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown), and the code files are
recommended to be added to pythonpath for full fledged functionallity, or use the same as a submodule.
